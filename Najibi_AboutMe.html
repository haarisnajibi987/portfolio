   <p id="paragraph">Building, repairing, and painting cars. This is my career in the future. I want to become an Automotive Body Specialist. I want to pursue this career because there is something satisfying about putting things back together and bringing life to something old and/or heavily damaged. My plans to become an Automotive Body Specialist is to go to a community college and get my Associates Degree in Auto Body Repair and maybe get an internship at my uncle's shop.</p>

    <p id="paragraph">Some of the skills I posses is being cautious, cooperative, and organized. I tend to be very cautious especially when I am doing something outside of my comfort zone and I think that could be helpful in my career. I am also very neat and organized which is useful in my career. For example, Auto Body Mechanics work with lots of tools and itâ€™s useful to have everything organized and ready for use so that you focus more on your main priority and waste less time.</p>

    <p id="paragraph">I have participated in some sports like Soccer and Wrestling. I have won many medals from my few years in Soccer. I also contributed to a trophy me and my team won in Wrestling and I am very proud of that. What I have learned about myself is that I like to work in teams and independently.</p>

   <p id="paragraph">All in all I think I have a bright future ahead of me with the skills I have. Thank you for taking your time to read about me and my future. Please take the time to explore the rest of my website.</p>
